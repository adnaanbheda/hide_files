# Hide your Files

Simple Python 3 script that will randomize file names, um, maybe randomize isn't appropriate but it shifts characters to a key value like a Caeser Cipher.

Nothing too complex. Utility function for my own needs.
Argument Parsing enabled.

-d or --dir       : Target directory
--decrypt         : Decrypts the target folder
-k or --key       : The value you want to shift your characters to
-r or --recursive : Flag for determining whether subdirectories are meant to be decrypted or not  (WIP)
